# Phone
Program designed for user to enter and view information about their phone.

After learning about Inheritance, you try to test your understanding by building a Phone class that will
represent phones and a class that inherits from this class called SmartPhone which represents phones that
have access to World Wide Web. The Phone class will have one instance variable to represent the model
of the phone. SmartPhone will inherit from the Phone class and will have one instance variable that
stores the web address of the page that the phone is currently on. Each class should be built using objectoriented methodology by making its instance variables private and developing public methods to access
and mutate the instance variables of each class. The public methods of Phone will be inherited by
SmartPhone and should not be duplicated in the SmartPhone class. These classes do not need to override
any methods from the Object class.
After developing these two classes, build a demo class that creates an object of the Phone class and an
object of the SmartPhone class. The program should give the user five options. The first option will
allow the user to enter the information about their phone. The second option will allow the user to enter
the information about their smart phone. The third option will allow the user to look at or review the
information about their phone. The fourth option will allow the user to look at or review the information
about their smart phone. The fifth option should end the program. If any other option is selected the user
should be given an error message and given another chance to choose of one of the options.
